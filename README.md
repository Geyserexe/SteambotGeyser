Run by making a copy of config-template.json called config.json, then change the parameters to those desired.
A whole bunch of this stuff is hardcoded to allow me to use commands, so you can, of course, go through and replace every hardcoded instance of my name and the bot's name, and even more of it is trivia room stuff for when Jeopard-E is down.
Please don't run that stuff without getting permission from the trivia staff or they will eviscerate you.
